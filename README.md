# Discord-decide-bot
Write .decide in order for the bot to give you a yes or no answer. Replace with your api token. This bot is a copy of the slack bot functionality that discord is lacking


I'm working on making the flask functionality work. It just needs a little bit of tinkering. The normal bot routine is working however.

You don't need flask to be up for this to work, I am adding it for log keeping. Who requests the bot and passes it to a webui.
